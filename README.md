# Big Data Management

The astounding growth of data in all aspects of life in the form of emails, weblogs, tweets, sensors, videos and text has necessitated the use of Big Data and advanced analytics techniques to support large scale data analytics. The goal of this course is to enable students to design and build analytics applications through highly scalable systems capable of collecting, processing, storing and analyzing large volumes of structured and unstructured data. Students will learn about visualizing large datasets, extracting data using public APIs, analyzing unstructured (text) data and finally running a deep learning model for image processing. This course will provide students experience to conduct analytics using technologies such as Tableau, Gephi and KNIME.
